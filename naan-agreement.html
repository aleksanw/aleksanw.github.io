<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; margin-bottom: 2em;">NAAN-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (NDA)</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; hyphens: auto;">This Naan-Disclosure Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into on this day by and between the party providing the culinary article (the "Disclosing Party") and the party receiving said article (the "Recipient"), for the purpose of preventing the unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, as defined below.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; hyphens: auto;">WHEREAS, the Disclosing Party has developed, or has otherwise come into possession of, certain proprietary information and sensory data related to a specific baked good which the Recipient has had the privilege to witness, handle, and sample (ingest) to the fullest extent permitted by appetite and local statutes.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; hyphens: auto;">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and the opportunity to partake in the aforementioned baked good, the parties hereto agree as follows:</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">1. DEFINITION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; hyphens: auto;">For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall include all sensory, textural, and experiential data related to the specific item known colloquially and hereinafter as "Naan." For the avoidance of doubt, "Naan" is further defined as, but not limited to:</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; hyphens: auto; padding-left: 20px;">
a) Naan pan bread ("naan");<br>
b) Leavened Tandoor-Fired Subcontinental Flatbread Product;<br>
c) Garlic/Butter Infusion Matrix;<br>
d) The Doughvine Secret; and<br>
e) Curry Accompaniment Substrate, Primary.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; hyphens: auto;">
Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, its precise level of fluffiness, the exact char-to-softness ratio, its "pull-apart" characteristics, its aromatic profile, its structural integrity when used as a scooping apparatus, and the subjective feeling of deep, profound satisfaction upon consumption. This Agreement does not, under any circumstances, extend to cardboard or its derivatives, regardless of how they are flavored or presented.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">2. OBLIGATIONS OF RECIPIENT</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; hyphens: auto;">The Recipient shall hold and maintain the Confidential Information in strictest confidence for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Disclosing Party. The Recipient shall not, without prior written approval of the Disclosing Party, use for their own benefit, publish, copy, or otherwise disclose to others, or permit the use by others for their benefit, the Confidential Information. Specifically, the Recipient is forbidden from:</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; hyphens: auto; padding-left: 20px;">
a) Uttering phrases such as, "You wouldn't believe the naan I just had," in any public or semi-public forum, including but not limited to group texts and poorly monitored social media accounts.<br>
b) Attempting to reverse-engineer the "Naan" through amateur kitchen experiments, thereby creating inferior facsimiles that would dishonor the original.<br>
c) Describing the experience to any culinary expert, food blogger, or self-proclaimed pundit in a manner that would allow for its classification or ranking against lesser breads.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">3. SCOPE AND DURATION</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; hyphens: auto;">The non-disclosure provisions of this Agreement shall apply only under the following conditions:</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; hyphens: auto; padding-left: 20px;">
a) The obligations herein are binding if, and only if, the Recipient subjectively and in good faith determines the "Naan" to be The Best Naan in Known Existence. A finding of "very good" or "decidedly above average" shall render this Agreement null and void.<br>
b) The term of this agreement shall commence upon the first bite and shall terminate upon the earlier of: (i) forty-eight (48) hours, or (ii) the moment the Recipient consumes an inferior bread product (e.g., a common dinner roll), which shall be deemed to have cleansed the palate and reset all prior culinary benchmarks.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">4. REMEDIES</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; hyphens: auto;">In the event of a breach of this Agreement, the Disclosing Party is entitled to seek relief, which may include requiring the Recipient to attend a brief but tedious presentation on the proper fermentation of yeast. The Recipient acknowledges that all terms herein are, for all intents and purposes, naan-negotiable.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">5. MISCELLANEOUS</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; hyphens: auto;">This Agreement shall be governed by the unwritten and often-ignored laws of culinary etiquette. This document constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior discussions, which were likely about how hungry everyone was. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p style="font-size: 11px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; hyphens: auto; margin-top: 3em;">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.</p>
